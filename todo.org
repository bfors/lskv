open(path) → lskv | {error, any()}

get(Key) → {ok, value}

set(Key, Value) → {error, any()}

delete(Key) → ok | {error, any()}

list_keys() → [Key] | {error, any()}

fold(,Fun,Acc0) → Acc
Fold over all K/V pairs in a Kvs datastore. Fun is expected to be of the form: F(K,V,Acc0) → Acc.

merge(DirectoryName) → ok | {error, any()}
Merge several data files within a lsvk datastore into a more compact form.

sync() → ok
Force any writes to sync to disk.

close() → ok
